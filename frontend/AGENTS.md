## CRITICAL RULES - NON-NEGOTIABLE

### React & Next.js

- ALWAYS: Use functional components and hooks.
- ALWAYS: Await Dynamic APIs in Next.js 16 (`params`, `searchParams`, `cookies()`, etc.).
- ALWAYS: Use `next/form` for native form enhancement.
- ALWAYS: Verify implementation by running the validation script (`pnpm run validate`) which includes linting and building.
- NEVER: Use `useMemo` or `useCallback` (React Compiler handles this).
- NEVER: Use `var()` or hex colors in classNames.

### Types & State

- ALWAYS: Define constants for unions and use `typeof` for types.
- ALWAYS: Keep interfaces flat (one level depth) and extend them.
- ALWAYS: Use `zod` for all form and API validation.

## DECISION TREES

### Component Placement

```
New UI Component? → packages/ui (shared) or apps/web/components (local)
Shared across apps? → packages/ui
Local to one feature? → apps/web/app/{feature}/_components/
```

### Code Location

```
Server Action → apps/web/actions/
API Types → packages/types/
Shared Styles → packages/ui/styles/
Shared Hooks → packages/ui/hooks/ (if shared)
```

## COMMANDS (from frontend root)

```bash
# Register dependencies
pnpm install

# Run dev server
pnpm --filter web dev

# Run linting
pnpm run lint

# Generate types from backend schema
pnpm run openapi:generate
```

## QA CHECKLIST BEFORE COMMIT

- [ ] `pnpm run typecheck` passes
- [ ] `pnpm run lint` passes (Biome)
- [ ] `pnpm run build` (or `pnpm run validate`) passes without errors
- [ ] Next.js 16 Async APIs are correctly awaited
- [ ] Responsive design verified (mobile/desktop)
- [ ] Dark mode compatibility checked
- [ ] Proper error/loading states implemented
- [ ] Server actions have proper validation
